# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Welcome to the major project for CISC/CMPE 204!

Change this README.md file to summarize your project, and provide pointers to the general structure of the repository. How you organize and build things (which files, how you structure things, etc) is entirely up to you! The only things you must keep in place are what is already listed in the **Structure** section below.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.

## Running With Docker

1. First, download Docker https://www.docker.com/get-started

2. Navigate to your project folder on the command line.

3. We first have to build the course image. To do so use the command:
`docker build . -t cisc204`

4. Now that we have the image we can run the image as a container by using the command: `docker run -it -v $(pwd):/PROJECT cisc204 /bin/bash`

    $(pwd) will be the current path to the folder and will link to the container

    /PROJECT is the folder in the container that will be tied to your local directory

5. From there the two folders should be connected, everything you do in one automatically updates in the other. For the project you will write the code in your local directory and then run it through the docker command line. A quick test to see if they're working is to create a file in the folder on your computer then use the terminal to see if it also shows up in the docker container.
